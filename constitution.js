CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

PREAMBLE

Cardano is a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and community governance, c
to improving economic, political, and social systems for everyone, everywhere. By offering this foundational infra
Cardano empowers individuals and communities to manage their identity, value and governance, fostering the e
of decentralized applications, businesses and network states.

Through unbiased processing of immutable data, we, the participants of the Cardano Community, consisting of
organizations, contributors and others, choose to follow in the footsteps of the early Internet and cryptocurrency
who first forged bonds of community through digital technologies. We are guided by our shared principles and te
exercise our self-governance by balancing decentralized decision-making with accountability and safeguarding
of the Cardano Blockchain.

Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework, that neither relies nor depends up
traditional nation-state governance systems, but instead relies on self-governance by the Cardano Community,
wherever possible and beneficial, blockchain technology in the governance process, we hereby establish this C
Constitution to govern the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, ensure the continuity of the Cardano Blockchain, an
rights of those who utilize it.

With these purposes in mind, we, the Cardano Community, affirm our intention to abide by this Constitution in o
participate in the governance of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. We invite all who share our values to join u
not in the way of any who wish to take another path.

ARTICLE I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS

Section 1

These below Tenets shall guide all participants of the Cardano Community, including the Constitutional Committ
proposed governance actions shall be evaluated in accordance with these Tenets. The order in which the below
appear is not intended to represent a priority among Tenets.

TENET 1 Transactions on the Cardano Blockchain shall not be slowed down or censored and shall be expedier
for their intended purpose.

TENET 2 The cost of transactions on the Cardano Blockchain shall be predictable and not unreasonable.

TENET 3 Anyone desiring to develop and deploy applications on the Cardano Blockchain shall not unreasonabl
prevented from developing and deploying such applications as intended.

TENET 4 Contributions by the Cardano Community on the Cardano Blockchain shall be recognized, recorded a
assessed fairly through reward sharing with SPOs, potential compensation to DReps and CC members, and ap
tokenomics.

TENET 5 The Cardano Blockchain shall not lock in an ada owner's value or data without the owner's consent.

TENET 6 The Cardano Blockchain shall not unreasonably impede interoperability.

TENET 7 The Cardano Blockchain shall preserve in a safe manner any value and information stored on the Cam
Blockchain.

TENET 8 The Cardano Blockchain shall not unreasonably spend resources.

TENET 9 All users of the Cardano Blockchain shall be treated fairly and impartially, taking into account the colle
desires of the Cardano Blockchain Community, consistent with the long-term sustainability and viability of the C.
Blockchain.

TENET 10 Financial stability shall be maintained and the total supply of ada shall not exceed 45,000,000,000
(45,000,000,000,000,000 lovelace).

Section 2

The Cardano Blockchain shall operate in accordance with the Guardrails for the Cardano Blockchain as set fort
Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix to this Constitution. The Cardano Community may from time to time d
codify certain Guardrails such that the Guardrails are directly programmed and implemented on the Cardano Bl
using on-chain Guardrails Scripts or built-in ledger rules.

In the event there are inconsistencies between a Guardrail as set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Ap
any such Guardrail that has been programmed and implemented on the Cardano Blockchain, the version of suc
that has been deployed directly on the Cardano Blockchain shall prevail unless and until replaced or revised pu
an on-chain governance action. The Constitutional Committee shall seek to reconcile such inconsistencies thro
encouragement of an appropriate on-chain governance action.

ARTICLE II. THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN COMMUNITY

Section 1

No formal membership shall be required to use, participate in and benefit from the Cardano Blockchain. Instead
of ada, all developers of, all those building on, and all those otherwise supporting, maintaining or using the Caro
Blockchain are considered to be participants in the Cardano Community and are therefore recognized as benefi
the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. All participants in the Cardano Community are accordingly beneficiaries of
Constitution, entitled to its rights, privileges and protections and, as such, are expected to support and uphold th
Constitution.

Section 2

Participants in the Cardano Community who own ada are entitled to access and participate in the on-chain
decision-making processes of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, including voting and taking part in on-chain g
actions regarding the Cardano Blockchain.

Section 3

The Cardano Community has a responsibility to maintain the integrity of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem by
this Constitution, operating the Cardano Blockchain, participating in Cardano Blockchain governance activities,
resolving disputes in a fair and transparent manner.

Section 4

The Cardano Community is entitled and encouraged through the provisions of this Constitution to collaborate in
developing, maintaining and building applications for the Cardano Blockchain, and to form temporary and perma
organizations, associations and other entities as the Cardano Community deems desirable or appropriate in sup
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

ARTICLE III. PARTICIPATORY AND DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE

Section 1

The Cardano Blockchain shall be governed by a decentralized, on-chain governance model, utilizing, to the exte
and beneficial, smart contracts and other blockchain based tools to facilitate decision-making and ensure transp
On-chain voting for governance actions shall follow the process outlined in this Constitution, including the Carda
Blockchain Guardrails Appendix. On-chain governance actions shall be effected through a collective decision-m
process, with specific consensus threshold requirements, as required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.
Section 2

Three independent governance bodies shall participate in voting for on-chain governance actions to provide che
balances for the Cardano Blockchain, consisting of Delegated Representatives (DReps), Stake Pool Operators
and the Constitutional Committee (CC).

Section 3

All owners of ada shall have the right to vote in on-chain governance decision-making processes, as provided fo
Constitution and the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix. All owners of ada shall have the right to propose
to the governance structure of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem in accordance with the Guardrails. Owners o
use third-party custodians or other designees to hold their ada, may authorize or may withhold authorization for
third-parties to vote on their behalf.

Section 4

A special form of on-chain governance action, an "Info" action, exists to allow the Cardano Community to propo
future on-chain governance actions and to allow community sentiment to be gauged without committing to any c
change to the Cardano Blockchain. Such "Info" actions have no on-chain effect other than to record such "Info"
the Cardano Blockchain. In accordance with Article VII Section 4, "Info" actions shall also be used in connection
proposed Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets and Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals.

Section 5

In order to promote transparency in the process of on-chain governance, prior to being recorded or enacted on-
proposed governance actions are expected to follow a standardized and legible format including a URL and has
documented off-chain content to the Cardano Blockchain. Sufficient rationale shall be provided to justify the req
change to the Cardano Blockchain. The rationale shall include, at a minimum, a title, abstract, reason for the pro
relevant supporting materials.

The content of every on-chain governance action must be identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed

"Hard Fork Initiation" and "Protocol Parameter Change" governance actions shall undergo sufficient technical re
scrutiny as mandated by the Guardrails to ensure that the governance action does not endanger the security, fu
performance or long-term sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain. On-chain governance actions should addres
expected impact on the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

All owners of ada shall have the right to ensure that the process for participating in, submitting and voting on on
governance actions is open and transparent and is protected from undue influence and manipulation.

Section 6

The Cardano Community is expected to support the creation, maintenance and ongoing administration of off-ch
governance processes as may be necessary to give effect to this Constitution and to ensure that there is aware
an opportunity to debate and shape all future governance actions for the Cardano Blockchain.

ARTICLE IV. THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM BUDGET

Section 1

Any participant in the Cardano Community may propose a Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget at any time.
Cardano Community is expected to periodically propose one or more budgets for the ongoing operation, mainte
future development of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem and for covering other costs related to the implement
administration and maintenance of the decentralized, on-chain governance processes provided for in this Const
Cardano Community may propose one aggregate budget or multiple budgets for the Cardano Blockchain ecosy
budgets are expected to cover not less than a period of 73 epochs (approximately one calendar year) but nothin
prevent the Cardano Community from proposing budgets for shorter or longer time periods. All owners of ada a
to periodically approve one or more Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets through an on-chain "Info" action.
provided in Section 3 of this Article IV, withdrawals may be made from the Cardano Blockchain treasury as nece
time to time to give effect to the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget or budgets then in effect. Existing budg
amended following the same process as provided in this Section 1.

Section 2

Development of Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets and the administration of such budgets shall utilize, to
possible and beneficial, smart contracts and other blockchain based tools to facilitate decision-making and ensu
transparency. Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano B
treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversig
Section 3

Withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury that would cause the Cardano Blockchain treasury balance
the then applicable net change limit shall not be permitted. No withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasu
permitted unless such withdrawals have been authorized and are being made pursuant to a budget for the Carc
Blockchain that is then in effect as required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, and which has not
determined by the Constitutional Committee to be unconstitutional.

Section 4

Any governance action requesting ada from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall require an allocation of ada
such funding request to cover the cost of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metri
use of such ada. Contractual obligations governing the use of ada received from the Cardano Blockchain treasu
pursuant to a Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget shall include dispute resolution provisions.

Section 5

Any ada received from a Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawal, so long as such ada is being held directly or
by an administrator prior to further disbursement, must be kept in one or more separate accounts that can be au
the Cardano Community, and such accounts shall not be delegated to an SPO but must be delegated to the pre
auto abstain voting option.

ARTICLE V. DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES

Section 1

In order to participate in governance actions, owners of ada may register as DReps and directly vote on such go
actions or may delegate their voting rights to other registered DReps who shall vote on their behalf.
Section 2

Any owner of ada shall have the option to register as a DRep. Owners of ada shall be allowed to delegate their
stake to one or more registered DReps, including themselves. DReps may be individuals or coordinated groups
ada who use third-party custodians or other designees to hold their ada, may authorize, or may withhold authori
such third-parties to delegate the voting rights of the ada owner to registered DReps on the owner's behalf. DRe
entitled to cast votes directly for on-chain governance actions and represent those ada owners delegating their
rights to them. DRep voting thresholds are set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix.

This voting system shall enshrine a liquid democracy model where owners of ada can seamlessly select among
register as a DRep, and withdraw or change their delegation at any time.

Section 3

DReps who are representing delegators are expected to periodically adopt, and update as they deem appropria
of conduct governing their activities as DReps and make such codes of conduct publicly available. DReps are e
to include ethical guidelines in their codes of conduct.

Section 4

The Cardano Community is expected to support the creation, maintenance and ongoing administration of tools
owners of ada to explore and evaluate DRep candidates, access and evaluate DRep codes of conduct and sele
on such criteria as they deem relevant.

Section 5

DReps who are representing delegators may be compensated for their efforts. DReps shall ensure that any con
received in connection with their activities as a DRep is disclosed.

Section 6

DReps shall not pay compensation to an ada owner or to an owner's designee in exchange for being appointed
such ada owner or by its designee or for voting on behalf of such ada owner or its designee.

ARTICLE VI. STAKE POOL OPERATORS

Section 1

SPOs shall have a specific role in approving critical on-chain governance actions that require additional oversig
independence, voting separately and independently from DReps as set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardra
Appendix. SPOs shall participate in hard fork initiation processes as the operators of the nodes that participate
Blockchain's consensus mechanism.

Section 2

SPOs shall act as a check on the power of the Constitutional Committee under exceptional circumstances by se
voting on "Motion of no confidence" and "Update committee/threshold and/or term" governance actions, and on
"Parameter Update" governance actions that affect security-critical parameters set forth under Parameters that
to the Operation of the Blockchain in Section 2.1 of the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix.

Section 3

SPOs are encouraged to periodically adopt, and update as they deem appropriate, codes of conduct governing
activities as SPOs and make such codes of conduct publicly available. SPOs are encouraged to include ethical
in their codes of conduct.

Section 4

Owners of ada who are both SPOs and acting as DReps shall publicly disclose that they are participating in on-
governance actions in both such capacities prior to exercising any on-chain governance rights.

ARTICLE VII. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE

Section 1

A Constitutional Committee shall be established as the branch of Cardano's on-chain governance process that
governance actions to be enacted on-chain are consistent with this Constitution. The Constitutional Committee
comprise a set of owners of ada that is collectively responsible for ensuring that on-chain governance actions pr
enactment on-chain, are constitutional. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Article VII, the Constitu
Committee shall be limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions to be enacted on-chain. Cons
Committee members are expected to have appropriate expertise to carry out their required responsibilities, con=
their past contributions and involvement in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

Section 2

The Constitutional Committee shall be composed of such number of members sufficient to assure the ongoing i
the Cardano Blockchain as determined from time to time by owners of ada. The minimum and maximum numbe
members of the Constitutional Committee shall be consistent with the minimum and maximum number of memb
forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix.

Members of the Constitutional Committee shall serve such term lengths as shall be determined from time to tim
owners of ada as consistent with the minimum and maximum term lengths as set forth in the Cardano Blockcha
Guardrails Appendix. To assure continuity in the operation of the Constitutional Committee, the terms for Consti
Committee members shall be staggered.

Section 3

The Cardano Community shall establish and make public a process from time to time for election of members o
Constitutional Committee consistent with the requirements of the Guardrails.

Section 4

No governance action, other than a "Motion of no confidence," or "Update Constitutional Committee/threshold a
may be implemented on-chain unless a requisite percentage of the members of the Constitutional Committee as
by the Guardrails shall have first determined and affirmed through an on-chain action that such proposal does n
this Constitution. Each Constitutional Committee member shall have one vote.

Because "Info" actions have no on-chain effect and, accordingly, are neither constitutional nor unconstitutional,
Constitutional Committee members may not prevent "Info" actions from being recorded on-chain. Members of th
Constitutional Committee may nevertheless record a vote on-chain regarding an "Info" action in order to expres
on such "Info" action, including whether the suggested course of action proposed in such "Info" action, would be
view of such member, unconstitutional if it were to be enforced by on-chain mechanisms.

In the case of "Info" actions that propose a Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget, Constitutional Committee m
shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be imple
the form contained in the "Info" action, would violate this Constitution.

In the case of "Info" actions that propose a withdrawal from the Cardano Blockchain treasury pursuant to a prev
approved budget, Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion a
whether such proposed withdrawal, if made in accordance with such "Info" action, would violate this Constitution
Section 5

The Constitutional Committee shall be considered to be in one of the following two states at all times: a state of
or a state of no-confidence. In a state of no-confidence, members of the then standing Constitutional Committee
reinstated or replaced using the "Update committee/threshold" governance action before any other on-chain go
action, other than "Info" actions, may go forward. During a state of no-confidence, "Info" actions other than "Info
relating to budget proposals or treasury withdrawal proposals, may continue to be recorded on-chain.

If a member of the Constitutional Committee is not carrying out its responsibilities as required by this Constitutic
determined by a requisite percentage as specified by the Guardrails of SPOs and DReps, voting separately pur
"Update Constitutional Committee/threshold and/or term" governance action, such member shall be removed fr
Constitutional Committee upon the implementation of the governance action. Thereafter, an election shall be he
as practical to replace the member so removed.

In the event of a "Motion of no confidence" governance action to remove all members of the Constitutional Com
the same time, that is approved by a requisite percentage as specified by the Guardrails of DReps and SPOs, L
implementation of the governance action, the Constitutional Committee shall be considered to be a state of no-c
until such time as an election has been held either to reinstate the existing Constitutional Committee members i
in part, or to elect new Constitutional Committee members.

Section 6

Constitutional Committee processes shall be transparent. The Constitutional Committee shall publish each deci
voting that a governance action proposed to be executed on-chain is unconstitutional, the Constitutional Commi
collectively, or each member of the Constitutional Committee casting such a vote separately, shall set forth the b
decision with reference to specific Articles of this Constitution or provisions of the Cardano Blockchain Guardrai
that are in conflict with a given proposal. Internal deliberations among members of the Constitutional Committee
casting votes, are not required to be publicly disclosed.

The Constitutional Committee shall operate pursuant to a code of conduct periodically adopted and published b
Constitutional Committee. The Constitutional Committee is encouraged to include ethical guidelines in its code
The Constitutional Committee shall periodically adopt and publish such policies and procedures as the Constitu
Committee shall deem necessary in carrying out its duties.

Section 7

The Cardano Community is expected to support the creation, maintenance and ongoing administration of tools
necessary and appropriate for the Constitutional Committee to perform its required functions.

Section 8

Constitutional Committee members may be compensated for their efforts as members of the Constitutional Com
Constitutional Committee members shall ensure that any compensation received in connection with their activiti
member is disclosed. Budgets approved for the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem may include allocations from th
Blockchain treasury sufficient to compensate Constitutional Committee members in such amounts as may be ap
from time to time by ada owners. Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets shall provide for periodic administrati
the Constitutional Committee in such amounts as requested from time to time by the Constitutional Committee a
approved by ada owners.

Section 9

Constitutional Committee members who are also acting as DReps, as SPOs, or both, shall publicly disclose tha
participating in on-chain governance actions in more than one such capacity prior to voting with respect to on-ch
governance actions.

ARTICLE VIII. AMENDMENT PROCESS

Section 1

This Constitution should be treated as a living document. Technical advancements, changes in the desires, nee
expectations of the Cardano Community, and unforeseen circumstances may give rise to the need in the future
this Constitution. The Cardano Community is encouraged to periodically review and debate its provisions, and v
desired, come together in such forums as the Cardano Community may deem appropriate, to propose amendm
Constitution. Amendments may be made as provided in this Article VIII.

Section 2

Except as otherwise so provided in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, amendments to this Constitut
including to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, shall be approved by a collective decision-making pro
requiring an on-chain governance action by owners of ada satisfying a threshold of no less than 65% of the ther
voting stake.

Section 3

If the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix sets forth an amendment threshold for a Guardrail that is differe
amendment threshold contained in Section 2 of this Article VIII, then the threshold set forth in the Cardano Bloc
Guardrails Appendix for such Guardrail shall apply.

APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

1. Introduction

To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance, it is necessary to establish sensible Guardrails that wil
the Cardano Blockchain to continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way.

This Appendix sets forth Guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance actions, i
changes to the protocol parameters and limits on treasury withdrawals. These Guardrails cover both essential,
limits on settings, and recommendations that are based on experience, measurement and governance objective

These Guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of the Cardano Blockchain. Th
intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid potential problems with security, performa
functionality or long-term sustainability. As described below, some of these Guardrails are automatable and will
enforced via an on-chain Guardrails Script or built-in ledger rules.

These Guardrails apply only to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment. They are not intended to
test environments or to other blockchains that use Cardano Blockchain software.

Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently. Some parameters interact with
settings in an intrinsic way. Where known, these interactions are addressed in this Appendix.

While the Guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of technical insight, this Appendix should
as a living document. Implementation improvements, new simulations or performance evaluation results for the
Blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in these Guardrails to be relaxed (or, in some circumsta
require them to be tightened) in due course.

Additional Guardrails may also be needed where, for example, new protocol parameters are introduced.

Amending, Adding or Deprecating Guardrails

The Guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time pursuant to an on-chain governanc
that satisfies the applicable voting threshold as set forth in this Appendix. Any such amendment to any Guardra
require and be deemed to be an amendment to the Constitution itself, including any new Guardrails. Each Guar
unique label. If the text of a Guardrail is amended, the existing Guardrail will be deprecated and a new label will
this Appendix. Similarly, if a Guardrail is completely deprecated, its label will never be reused in the future. In all
Guardrails that apply to a governance action will be those in force at the time that the governance action is subr
chain, regardless of any later amendments.

Terminology and Guidance

Should/Should not. Where this Appendix says that a value "should not" be set below or above some value, thi
that the Guardrail is a recommendation or guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion or altera
suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano Community in light of experience with the Cardano Blockchair
governance system or the operation of the Cardano Blockchain.

Must/Must not. Where this Appendix says that a value "must" or "must not" be set below or above some value,
means that the Guardrail is a requirement that will be enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules, types or oth
mechanisms where possible, and that if not followed could cause a protocol failure, security breach or other unc
outcome.

Benchmarking. Benchmarking refers to careful system level performance evaluation that is designed to show a
for example, 95% of blocks will be diffused across a global network of Cardano Blockchain nodes within the req
time interval in all cases. This may require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a large test
Cardano Blockchain nodes, simulating a global Cardano Blockchain network.

Performance analysis. Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical performance, empirical benchmar
simulation results to predict actual system behavior. For example, performance results obtained from tests in a
test environment (such as a collection of data centers with known networking properties) may be extrapolated to
likely performance behavior in a real Cardano Blockchain network environment.

Simulation. Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to inform performance/functionality decisio
repeatable way. For example, the IOSim Cardano Blockchain module allows the operation of the networking sta
simulated in a controlled and repeatable way, allowing issues to be detected before code deployment.

Performance Monitoring. Performance monitoring involves measuring the actual behavior of the Cardano Bloc
network, for example, by using timing probes to evaluate round-trip times, or test blocks to assess overall netwo
complements benchmarking and performance analysis by providing information about actual system behavior t
be obtained using simulated workloads or theoretical analysis.

Reverting Changes. Where performance monitoring shows that actual network behavior following a change is
inconsistent with the performance requirements for the Cardano Blockchain, then the change must be reverted
previous state if that is possible. For example, if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of b
no longer diffused within 5s, then a change must be made to revert the block size to 100KB. If this is not possib
or more alternative changes must be made that will ensure that the performance requirements are met.

Severity Levels. Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are classified by severity level, where:

Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the security,
performance, functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain network
Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the security,
performance, functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain network
Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security, performance,

functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain network

Future Performance Requirements. Planned development such as new mechanisms for out of memory storag
impact block diffusion or other times. When changing parameters, it is necessary to consider these future perfor
requirements as well as the current operation of the Cardano Blockchain. Until development is complete, the re
will be conservative but may then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior.

Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

A script hash is associated with the Constitution hash when a New Constitution or Guardrails Script governa
is enacted. It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types, filtering non-compliant governance a

The Guardrails Script only affects two types of governance actions:

Parameter Update actions, and

Treasury Withdrawal actions.

The Guardrails Script is executed when either of these types of governance action is submitted on-chain. This a
scenarios where, for example, an erroneous script could prevent the Cardano Blockchain from ever enacting a
action, resulting in deadlock. There are three different situations that apply to Guardrail Script usage.

Symbol and Explanation

(y) The Guardrail Script can be used to enforce the Guardrail

(x) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail

(~- reason) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail for the reason
given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of Guardrails will apply.

Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document, then the Guardrail Script must not permit any chang
parameter.

Conversely, where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable Guardrails are specified, th
Script must not impose any constraints on changes to the parameter.

2. Guardrails and Guidelines on Protocol Parameter Update Actions

Below are Guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable protocol parameter settings via the protocol param
governance action such that the Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as a result of such chan

Note that, to avoid ambiguity, this Appendix uses the parameter name that is used in protocol parameter update
governance actions rather than any other convention.

GUARDRAILS

PARAM-01 (y) Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this document must not be changed by a
update governance action

PARAM-02a (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable Guardrails are
the Guardrails Script must not impose any constraints on changes to the parameter. Checkable Guardrails are
a (y)

2.1. Critical Protocol Parameters

The below protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.

Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain

maximum block body size (maxBlockBodySize)
maximum transaction size $(maxT\times Size)$ 

maximum block header size (maxBlockHeaderSize)

GUARDRAILS

PARAM-03a (y) Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: SPOs must say "y
collective support of more than 50% of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the Guardrails on th
pool voting threshold.

PARAM-04a (x) At least 3 months should normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to cha
critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This Guardrail
relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evalua

enforced by the Guardrails on the DRep voting thresholds.

PARAM-06a (x) At least 3 months should normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to cha
parameter that is critical to the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governan
This Guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technica
discussion and evaluation.

2.2. Economic Parameters

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

Enable long-term economic sustainability for the Cardano Blockchain;

Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the Cardano
Blockchain;

Ensure that ada owners are adequately rewarded for using stake in constructive ways,
including when delegating ada for block production; and

Balance economic incentives for different Cardano Blockchain ecosystem stakeholders,
including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, ada owners, DeFi users, infrastructure
users, developers (e.g. DApps) and financial intermediaries (e.g. exchanges)

Triggers for Change

Significant changes in the fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems with security,

performance, functionality or long-term sustainability

Changes in transaction volumes or types

Community requests or suggestions

Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters

Counter-indicators

Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation. They need to account for:

External economic factors

Network security concerns

Core Metrics

state (or a similar state)

How to recover the network in the event of disastrous failure

This plan should be followed if problems are observed following the parameter change. Note that not all chang
reverted. Additional care must be taken when making changes to these parameters.

2.7. Non-Updatable Protocol Parameters

Some fundamental protocol parameters cannot be changed by the Protocol Parameter Update governance acti
parameters can only be changed in a new Genesis file as part of a hard fork. It is not necessary to provide spec
guardrails on updating these parameters.

3. Guardrails and Guidelines on Treasury Withdrawal Actions

Treasury withdrawal actions specify the destination and amount of a number of withdrawals from the Cardano

GUARDRAILS

TREASURY-01a (x) A net change limit for the Cardano treasury's balance per period of time must be agreed by
DReps via an on-chain governance action with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake

TREASURY-02a (x) Withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury made pursuant to an approved Cardan
Blockchain ecosystem budget must not exceed the net change limit for the Cardano Treasury's balance per pe

TREASURY-03a (x) Withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury must be denominated in ada

TREASURY-04a (x) Withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury must not be ratified until there is a Car
Community approved Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget then in effect pursuant to a previous on-chain gov
action agreed by the DReps with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake

4. Guardrails and Guidelines on Hard Fork Initiation Actions

The hard fork initiation action requires both a new major and a new minor protocol version to be specified.

As positive integers

As the result of a hard fork, new updatable protocol parameters may be introduced. Guardrails may be defined
parameters, which will take effect following the hard fork. Existing updatable protocol parameters may also be d
by the hard fork, in which case the guardrails become obsolete for all future changes.

GUARDRAILS

HARDFORK-01 (~no access to existing parameter values) The major protocol version must be the same as c
greater than the major version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change. If the major protocol version
greater, then the minor protocol version must be zero

HARDFORK-02a (~ - no access to existing parameter values) Unless the major protocol version is also change
minor protocol version must be greater than the minor version that will be enacted immediately prior to this cha

HARDFORK-03 (~ no access to existing parameter values) At least one of the protocol versions (major or min
must change

HARDFORK-04a (x) At least 85% of stake pools by active stake should have upgraded to a Cardano Blockcha
version that is capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version

HARDFORK-05 (x) Any new updatable protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork must be includ
Appendix and suitable guardrails defined for those parameters

HARDFORK-06 (x) Settings for any new protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork must be inclu
appropriate Genesis file

HARDFORK-07 (x) Any deprecated protocol parameters must be indicated in this Appendix

HARDFORK-08 (~no access to Plutus cost model parameters) New Plutus versions must be supported by a
version-specific Plutus cost model that covers each primitive that is available in the new Plutus version

5. Guardrails and Guidelines on Update Constitutional Committee or Threshold Actions

Update Constitutional Committee or Threshold governance actions may change the size, composition or rec
voting thresholds for the Constitutional Committee.

GUARDRAILS

UPDATE-CC-01a (x) Update Constitutional Committee and/or threshold and/or term governance actions m
ratified until ada holders have ratified through an on-chain governance action this Constitution

6. Guardrails and Guidelines on New Constitution or Guardrails Script Actions

New constitution or Guardrails Script actions change the hash of the on-chain Constitution and the associated C
Script.

GUARDRAILS

NEW-CONSTITUTION-01a (x) A New Constitution or Guardrails Script governance action must be submitte
any required guardrails for new parameters that are introduced via a Hard Fork governance action

NEW-CONSTITUTION-02 (x) If specified, the new Guardrails Script must be consistent with this Constitution
7. Guardrails and Guidelines on No Confidence Actions

No confidence actions signal a state of no confidence in the governance system. No guardrails are imposed on
Confidence actions.

GUARDRAILS

None

8. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON INFO ACTIONS

Info actions are not enacted on-chain. No guardrails are imposed on Info actions.

GUARDRAILS

None

APPENDIX II: SUPPORTING GUIDANCE

This Appendix II is intended to provide guidance in interpreting the Constitution and the Constitutional Committe
consider this Appendix II as it deems relevant and useful in carrying out its constitutional duties.

1. Framing Notes

The Cardano Blockchain was established in 2017. In July 2020 the Cardano Blockchain was expanded to incluc
independent block validators and in September 2024 an on-chain governance system was introduced. This Cor
outlines the rights and responsibilities of governance actors in the decentralized system who represent the own
the governance token of the Cardano Blockchain. The Cardano Blockchain is presently a decentralized ecosyst
blockchain technology, smart contracts, and community governance.

In approaching this Constitution, the Cardano Community recognizes that it must be remembered that this is no
constitution for only a blockchain but rather a constitution for a blockchain ecosystem - a much more ambitious
Accordingly, how governance actions are approved, while extremely important, is not the sole focus of this Cons
Rather, this Constitution provides the basis and fundamental framework through which all participants in the Ca
Community can come together to govern themselves and form radically new approaches to human interaction a
collaboration.

By necessity, this Constitution recognizes the role of and empowers the Constitutional Committee, confirms the
Cardano Community to participate in collective bodies for collaboration, gives effect to on-chain governance, an
empowers DReps to act as the voice of ada owners for on-chain voting.

The Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to and the use of funds of the Cardano B
treasury through the inclusion of the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails in this Constitution.

2. Other Guidance

The drafters of the Constitution, together with other participants from the Cardano Community, have published a
future may publish guidance for interpreting the Constitution, including, without limitation, a definition booklet tha
released contemporaneously with the on-chain ratification of the Constitution. So long as any such published gu
been hashed to the Cardano Blockchain pursuant to an "Info" action, the Constitutional Committee shall not be
from considering and utilizing such guidance as it deems appropriate.
